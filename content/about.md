Trade Chirps is a partnership set up between Sicily Fiennes (University of Kent), Nuruliawati Yuwono (Wildlife Conservation Society) and Karlina Indraswari (Queensland University of Technology).

Bird trade is a greatly undermined area of wildlife trade, and this project aims to amplify the diverse voices
of researchers and conservation practitioners who are involved in studying the impact of trade.
